# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-13)

**Core value:** Developers can manage all their SOPS-encrypted secrets from a single terminal interface without remembering CLI flags or writing shell scripts.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 5 (read loop)
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-14 -- Phase 2 planning complete

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 4
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 4 | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: -

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Security groundwork (WithAltScreen, tea.Cmd pattern) locked to Phase 1 — must ship before any secret-display code
- Roadmap: Clipboard signal handler wired to Phase 4 alongside git (both need OS-level signal awareness)
- Roadmap: Recipient management deferred to Phase 5 — highest-risk multi-file operation
- [Phase 02-read-loop]: MetadataContent defined as display-only struct independent of parser.SopsMetadata to avoid cross-plan build dependency during Wave 1 parallel execution
- [Phase 02-read-loop]: sahilm/fuzzy promoted to direct dependency in go.mod as SearchModel imports it directly

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- SOPS stdin editing with `encrypted_regex` — behavior undocumented, may surface during Phase 3 implementation
- Wayland clipboard limitation (needs xclip/xsel) — must document in README before Phase 4 ships
- `lipgloss.AdaptiveColor` hang (issue #1036) — use explicit colors throughout, not adaptive colors
- go-git v6 migration — reassess at Phase 4/5 boundary
